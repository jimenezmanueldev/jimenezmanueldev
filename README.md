- 👋 Hi, I’m @jimenezmanueldev
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a full time front end developer. I would love to work with other developers in different projects, but also create and develope my own project.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a front end stack that includes HTML, CSS, Javascript, React JS among other technologies/languages/frameworks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development.
- 📫 How to reach me >> Please send me any request or question at jimenezmanueldev@gmail.com
